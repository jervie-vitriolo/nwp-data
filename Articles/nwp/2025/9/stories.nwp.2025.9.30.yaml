        It was always my mom’s indulgence, the one ritual she never let go of no matter
        how difficult the year had been. As I unwrapped the ornaments one by one,
        arranging them on the branches, I found a strange comfort in the repetition.
        Each ornament felt like a fragment of memory, and with every piece I placed,
        I felt myself breathing a little easier.'

      text: 'My husband asked me then: Why do Filipinos celebrate Christmas so early?
        It’s a fair question, and one I couldn’t answer with history books or cultural
        milestones. There isn’t really a formal reason, only a shared impulse. We
        are known the world over for it, for stretching the season as far as we can.
        Maybe it’s because we’ve grown used to hardship, and Christmas is our way
        of looking forward, of insisting on joy before the year is even done. In a
        country where so little seems to change, where days can feel unbearably bleak,
        Christmas becomes more than a holiday—it is a way of moving on.'

      text: '<p>This chain restaurant has just about everything you want in a classic
        chicken wing spot. Their well-seasoned chicken wings (or fillets and tenders,
        if you prefer) are a delight, no matter the flavor. They currently offer 18,
        from milder options like Salted Egg and Creamy Truffle to the fiery Nuclear
        and Armageddon, which bring the intense heat of cayenne pepper and habanero.<br><em>Locations:

        steadily over the last decade as more people discovered the tasty delights

        wait—and the price. Big, generous pieces, perfectly battered and fried, with
        about 13 sauces and spice blends to choose from. Unique flavors like Taco
        and Korean Snowing Cheese stand out, and every order comes with a dip of your
        choice.<br><em>Locations: Marikina, Quezon City, Makati, Pasig</em></p>'
