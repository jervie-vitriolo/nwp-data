        Gerwig’s solo directorial debut is a fascinating look at the complex relationship
        between a mother and daughter at a most contentious time—senior year of high
        school. This coming-of-age dramedy expertly explores this dynamic to heartwarming
        results.</p>'

        creates frequent clashes. When Mei discovers she transforms into a red panda
        whenever she feels overwhelmed, it is her mother who ultimately helps her
        navigate the chaos. Through its magical storytelling, the film reminds us

        novel follows Margaret as she navigates puberty, adolescence, and the difficult
        questions that come with growing up, all while learning from her mother, Barbara.
        In one of the film’s most poignant moments, Barbara shares that she was disowned
        by her own mother because of the choices she made. This vulnerability helps
        Margaret understand her mother more deeply and brings the two closer together.
        It is a touching reminder of how a parent’s past shapes the kind of parent
        they become.</p>'
