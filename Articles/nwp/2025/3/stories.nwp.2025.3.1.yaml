      text: '"What we saw from the White House today is serious and disheartening.
        Ukraine still needs the US’s support, and Ukraine’s security and future
        are also important to the US and to Europe. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy
        has strong support in Ukraine, broad support in Europe, and he has led his
        people through a very demanding and brutal time, under attack from Russia.
        That Trump accuses Zelenskiy of gambling with World War III is deeply unreasonable
        and a statement I distance myself from. Norway stands with Ukraine in their
        struggle for freedom. We hope that the Trump administration also understands
        the importance of a just and lasting peace in Ukraine."'
