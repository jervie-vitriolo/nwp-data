    lead: 'What if? It’s the question that sparks new ideas, the kind that linger
      in the back of your mind, waiting to be explored. Most people let it fade—but
      not Kelvin Pundavela. Better known as Kelvin Bacon, he turned a simple curiosity
      about smoking his own bacon into a thriving brand. What started as a personal
      experiment quickly became a craft, a business, and a name people can’t forget.'

        Now that’s a conversation starter. It’s the kind of idea that sparks curiosity,
        opening the door to even more questions. At the heart of trying something
        new is a simple yet powerful question: What if? Most people entertain the
        thought but never take the leap—leaving the answer lingering in the air, unresolved.
        Then there are people like Kelvin Pundavela—better known as Kelvin Bacon—who
        don’t just ask the question, they dive right in to find the answer. Who knew
        that wondering “What if I smoke my own bacon?”&nbsp;could lead to a business
        venture? And a thriving one at that.</p>'

        \ trying again. Kelvin Bacon isn’t just about business; it’s about persistence,\
        \ passion, and remembering why you started in the first place. It’s an unconventional\
        \ love story, no doubt, but a satisfying one just the same. Because when you\

        \ savoring.\r"
