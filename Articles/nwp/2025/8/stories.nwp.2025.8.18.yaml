        food from all over the world, and wandered through Christmas markets that
        looked like they belonged in storybooks. But the charm began to fade. There
        were days when navigating life there made us feel like children on our first
        day of school, unsure of the rules, and fumbling through the simplest tasks.
        For our son, who was still figuring out the world, it was even harder. The
        cold was relentless, the language barrier turned simple errands into drawn-out
        challenges, and even the most ordinary tasks sometimes felt like mini-adventures
        you weren’t always in the mood for. Loneliness crept in quietly, despite the
        beauty.</p>'
