        The Attitude Sunly Mineral Stick really impressed me—I didn’t burn at all,

        in the middle of the chaos, strange billboards begin appearing that celebrate
        the life of an ordinary man named Charles Krantz. The adaptation by director
        Mike Flanagan stays true to King’s vision. Known more for their darker work,
        both King and Flanagan tap into their softer side, giving the movie a surprisingly
        heartfelt and hopeful touch.</p>'
