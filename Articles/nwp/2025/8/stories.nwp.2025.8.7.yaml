        the classic narrative to present-day Appalachia, touching on themes like the
        opioid crisis and systemic poverty. It’s heartbreaking yet hopeful, told
        through a voice that feels entirely new.</p>'

        known as Ghost Month. According to tradition, the gates of heaven and the
        underworld open during this time, allowing spirits to roam the world of the
        living. Some are said to seek closure or sustenance—and may even bring bad
        luck. That’s why many people avoid making big decisions like moving, traveling,
        or starting a business during this period and instead offer food and drink

        follows a woman who returns to her ancestral home in a remote village after
