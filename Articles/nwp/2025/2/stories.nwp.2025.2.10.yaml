        \ gift. Several pottery studios in Manila, such as Wabi Sabi PH, Tahanan Pottery,\
        \ and Bumi &amp; Ashe, offer workshops perfect for couples. Bumi &amp; Ashe\

      text: "Why settle for one restaurant when you can explore many? Instead of\
        \ splurging on a single pricey meal, go on a food crawl! The most popular\
        \ choice would be a Binondo Food Crawl, taking you through the best spots\
        \ with the most delicious food in Chinatown. Of course, you can create your\
        \ own food crawl with the amount of great dining options in places like Makati\
        \ or Taguig. For those looking for even more excitement, you can even try\
        \ bar hopping tours or pub crawls.\r"
