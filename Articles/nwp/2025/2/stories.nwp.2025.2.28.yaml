        begin with one of the pressing concerns. You once described the situation
        in the West Philippine Sea as a primary security challenge. And tensions have
        escalated in recent months with China doing dangerous maneuvers not only to
        Philippine vessels, but now including aircraft, sir. So given these developments
        at sea, how would you describe our relations with China?</p>'

        are really quite complex. I think I've said this before, it’s not only a
        relationship based on the, let’s’s say the situation of the South China
        Sea. We have a long economic relationship. China remains our number one trading
        partner. We have cultural exchanges. We still have a lot of people-to-people
        ties. So it’s a very broad and complex relationship. But even given that
        though, as you mentioned, the tensions in the South China Sea remain and the
        situation remains a security challenge to the Philippines in the sense that
        what is being challenged is not only our rights to use the resources and to
        take advantage of resources within our exclusive economic zone, but also our
        sovereignty and sovereign rights as laid and set forth in the UN Convention
        on the Law of the Sea. Our ability to assert our rights and take advantage
        of them. So all those together make this certainly a challenge for us.</p>'

      text: '<p><strong>MANALO:</strong> I think it helps because as you mentioned,
        by creating greater transparency, more countries and governments become aware
        of the situation. So every time there’s an incident, we would publicize it
        either through video or through other means. So nakikita ng mga ibang governments.
        And as you know, on many occasions, many governments came out with statements
        in support of the Philippines and basically supporting our right to be wherever
        that incident occurred and that what we were doing was within our legal rights.
        So I think the, I believe the transparency initiative works because it gives
        greater traction or greater publicity to what’s happening and people can
        see with their very eyes. And here, there really has been an incident that
        it’s not fabricated or based on simply written communications. You can actually
        see it and hear it. So I think in that sense, it has certainly been very helpful,
        at least in bringing the true situation out.</p>'

        the claimant states. And I think we've had very good discussions with them.

        to any country whether they wish to say it. What I can say, and I said this

        We issued not only a protest but a statement, I think there were two statements
        issued And not only by DFA but I think the National Maritime Council. We were
        deeply disturbed by this incident because, well, obviously it was a reckless
        disregard for safety. And that helicopter coming so close to a flight, which
        had every right to be there, certainly is disconcerting. Because, you know,
        maybe just a few more meters closer or another meter closer, you'll have
        had an accident. And an unavoidable accident was done on purpose to this maneuver.
        So in other words, it was a very dangerous maneuver and not in line or consistent
        with the procedures which are normal in terms of flying aircraft. So naturally,
        we're concerned with that kind of action.</p>'

        gave a map, no other country has come out in support of that. And we certainly
        are not going to be one of them since that falls within our sovereign rights,
        that area. And what’s most disconcerting here is that in this area, our rights
        to use that are now being challenged on the basis of what China calls its
        own law. And we will consistently not agree to that view. We will consistently
        not agree to that view. We will consistently assert our legal rights in accordance

        That if there’s an incident, something could happen which will elevate or

        level. And that’s something that we're trying of course to avoid. But that’s
        our concern. The more these incidents occur, the greater the risk that at
        one point something may happen beyond the control of either party. In other
        words, an accident. And therefore, like in the case of the helicopter, there
        had been a mistake by the pilot of the helicopter and there could have been
        an incident. So I think these are the things that we are concerned about.
        That’s why we feel it’s important that we have talks to see how we can,
        at any time, have talks or through diplomatic talks to see how we can ease
        tensions and prevent situations from escalating into something more. So this
        is always the concern that we have.</p>'

        to the provisional understanding that we reached with China. Now, this was
        two-way. This was not a request from the Philippines. It was both sides felt
        that maybe one way of dealing with this escalating tensions would be to have
        some kind of understanding. Kasi dati before they were saying there’s a so-called
        gentleman’s agreement. We never saw such an agreement. It was never in writing.
        So we have a provisional understanding which, and please note the word provisional,
        and in this provisional understanding it was made clear that none of the positions
        of either country would be affected. So in other words, ang position natin
        is maintained. And therefore, whatever we were saying regarding our sovereign
        rights along Ayungin Shoal, remains. And was not affected by the understanding.
        All the understanding did was create conditions whereby the supply missions
        could proceed peacefully. Unlike before, there were no rules of engagement,
        so nagkakaroon ng incidents. So in that way, the understanding has been helpful.
        And as you can see, our ship is still there, our assets are still being provided
        for, humanitarian missions basically, those are the missions, humanitarian
        are proceeding without any incident providing water and food. So, I think
        all the things that we had wanted actually are being done.</p>'

        First of all, the Typhoon missiles are not aimed at any country. They're
        there for our defense. And it’s actually the DND which is dealing with the
        operational aspect. But in principle, they're really there for our defense.
        And therefore, I really can't understand the continuous concern being expressed
        by China on their use. When you consider that China has certainly many more
        missile oils than the Philippines. And I don't know where they're aimed
        at. So I think there might be a bit of an overreaction to the Typhoon missiles,
        which are clearly for defensive purposes. And the Philippines has absolutely
        no intention of directing them at any certain country, unless you're attacked.
        But that’s why they're for defense.</p>'

        and further ASEAN integration. So, yun ang basic parameters namin. And as
        for the specifics, I can't go into them yet, but that will be our basic approach.
        In addition to these other issues which have been outstanding for some years,
        we have to see where we stand towards the end of the chairmanship of Malaysia.</p>'

        a very broad range of cooperation. I think it reflects the fact that many

        the importance of given the uncertainties, geopolitical uncertainties, it’s
        important that countries, partner with each other not only in, of course,
        on economic cooperation, but also on the defense security measures were possible.
        And the fact that we are, entering through these arrangements, shows that
        not only Philippines but even the countries we, enter into those arrangements
        also have similar perspective. So it’s I think this is really more of an
        effort to, address the, as I mentioned, the geopolitical uncertainties in
        our world. And, we are in that stage, apparently. So, our view is that the
