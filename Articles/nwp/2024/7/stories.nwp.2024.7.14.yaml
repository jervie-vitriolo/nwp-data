    caption: 'Russian President Vladimir Putin gestures while speaking at a news
      conference following a meeting of the State Council at the Kremlin in Moscow,
      Russia, on Thursday, Dec. 22, 2022. Treason cases were rare in Russia 30 years
      ago, with only a handful brought annually. In the last decade and especially
      since the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine, however, the number has soared,
      along with espionage prosecutions. Putin in 2022 urged security services to
      "harshly suppress the actions of foreign intelligence services (and) promptly
      identify traitors, spies and saboteurs." (Sergei Guneyev, Sputnik, Kremlin Pool

        rang at 6 a.m., and the voice on the other end said his father had been arrested,
        he thought it was a scam to extort money. A day earlier, he had taken his
        father, prominent Russian physicist Dmitry Kolker, to the hospital in his
        native Novosibirsk, when his advanced pancreatic cancer had suddenly worsened.</p>'
