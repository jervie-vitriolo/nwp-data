      to be a shot of adrenaline to an ailing film industry. 12 years later, it has
      become a viable sub-industry where showbiz lines become blurred for the sake
      of Philippine cinema — as well as a playground for TV stars who want to prove
      themselves worthy of being called an “actor.”'

      'text': '<p><strong>Manila (CNN Philippines Life) —</strong> In 2005, Cinemalaya
        began as a modest five-day festival with nine films and six shorts in competition.
        One of its initial intentions, aside from defibrillating a stagnant local
        film industry, was to populate the programming of then festival benefactor
        Tonyboy Cojuangco’s TV video-on-demand channel. It was an avenue for both
        established actors and young upstarts to rub elbows with each other and tell
        fresh and engaging stories — scarce commodities in a playing field that was
        mostly running with vehicles for network stars and the usual heap of commercial
        pap from the Metro Manila Film Festival. The Filipino independent film scene
        was relatively young back then, but had filmmakers like Brillante Mendoza,
        Lav Diaz, and Raymond Red leading the movement. Cinemalaya was at the cusp
        of this shift, providing the necessary push for filmmakers.</p>'

      'text': '<p>Films from the festival, such as Auraeus Solito’s “Ang Pagdadalaga
        ni Maximo Oliveros” and Pepe Diokno’s “Engkwentro,” went on to earn awards
        and recognition from film festivals abroad. The festival revived careers:
        directors who were long thought irrelevant were celebrated and actors who
        otherwise languished in teleseryes gained instant cred — and were even recognized
        for their impressive performances. In its 11-year competition, the list of
        awards has been a strange yet welcome rundown of veteran actors and upstarts,
        mostly coming from the weird and wonderful land of television. Whoever thought
        that LJ Reyes, after being in the Final Four of the reality talent search
        “StarStruck” in 2004, would go on to win Best Supporting Actress in 2010 for
        “The Leaving?” Or Eugene Domingo, would take home, first, Best Supporting
        Actress in 2008 for “100” (where Mylene Dizon also won for Best Actress) and
        then Best Actress for her breakout hit “Ang Babae sa Septic Tank” in 2011?
        Or even Joross Gamboa, erstwhile goofball and another reality talent search
        finalist, would win Best Supporting Actor for “Intoy Syokoy ng Kalye Marino”
        in 2012? These are actors whose performances on TV or commercial films are
        taken for granted, relegated to on-screen presence or comedic relief for the
        bigger artistas, but once out of the network pool and into the tempest of
        the indies, they emerge as genuine contenders.</p>'

        in a different country, Israel, which meant that she also had to learn Hebrew
        since her character is an Israel-born Filipino. It went on to win awards —

        Irma Adlawan’s first Best Actress trophy, and Best Supporting Actress for
        Smith, her first ever acting award. People took notice, and suddenly she wasn’t
        just Anne Curtis’s younger sister anymore, she was a young actress who could
        hold up on her own in scenes with stalwarts such as Adlawan (as the warring
        mother-daughter, their scenes involved a lot of bickering and shouting).</p>'

        her next career move. Acting alongside heavyweights such as Irma Adlawan and

      'text': '<p>That same year Smith was doing “Transit,” Benjamin Alves was also
        in a Cinemalaya film that would prove to be a boon to his career. It was his
        first year back in showbiz — he enjoyed a three-year stint as Vince Saldaña
        from 2006-2009 before he left to study abroad — and he already has dipped
        his toes in three auteurist outings: Adolfo Alix Jr’s “Death March,” Whammy
        Alcazaren’s “Islands,” and, the most pivotal of the three, Jerrold Tarog’s
        “Sana Dati,” where he played the ghost of boyfriend past to Lovi Poe’s tenderly
        tortured damsel. By that time, Poe had already accumulated quite an actress’s
        portfolio (such as a “Temptation Island” remake and co-starring with Nora
        Aunor on Brillante Mendoza’s “Thy Womb”). Alves, on the other hand was just
        a relative newbie, trying his hand at a role that would require him to whittle
        down his TV-style acting to a sparse yet evocative sense of despair and romanticism.</p>'

        about those veteran actors that they have a crazy intensity about them. In
        teleseryes, I’ve worked with Jaclyn Jose, with Chanda Romero and when you
        work with them, you can really feel their energy even if they’re not doing
        much in a scene. I guess it’s their training from the 70s or from when they
        used to shoot with film, because I guess when they used to shoot with film,
        they would really have to give it their all right away because otherwise,
        magagalit talaga yung mga directors. That’s why I really wanted to do it.”</p>'

      'text': '<p><strong>Manila (CNN Philippines Life) —</strong> It takes almost
        no effort to become acquainted with Archie comics (an American comic book
        series), even if you were a young kid living in the Philippines. For those
        who grew up reading them, Archie’s digest issues were readily available at
        local supermarkets and even 7-Elevens, and they were eye-catching and colorful,
        utterly collectible with diverse series and titles that could make even the
        pickiest child happy, if only for a few hours. Archie’s pals ‘n’ gals were
        reliable constants, relatable from their characterizations and plotlines,
        right down to the way they were drawn. It didn’t matter that they were inexplicably
        in space or solving supernatural mysteries — that was the Archieverse, and
        that was that. Whatever their exploits, Archie comics was well-loved by kids
        all over the world.</p>'
