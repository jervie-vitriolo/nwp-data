    'lead': 'Charo Santos–Concio''s comeback as an actor has long been overdue. After
      stepping down as the CEO and president of ABS–CBN, she''s been setting her sights
      on returning to the big screen. When the acclaimed director Lav Diaz asked her
      to play the lead in his new movie, "Ang Babaeng Humayo," the timing couldn''t
      have been more fortuitous, as it marks not only her first reappearance on film
      in years — and four decades since her debut in Mike de Leon''s "Itim" — but
      also a reacquaintance with her hometown, where it all started for her. '

      'text': '<p><strong>Manila (CNN Philippines Life)</strong> — “If you cannot
        tell your story in two hours, then you''re a bad filmmaker,” someone once
        told Lav Diaz, matter-of-factly. This someone happened to be a critic, an
        educator, a friend; someone who, since this kind of remark no longer fazed
        Diaz, would act in one of his longer films as Lino Brocka, an influential
        figure in his career. He, along with other teachers, would use Diaz as an
        example of how not to make a film, would make him the butt of their jokes.
        Incidentally, he also pronounced the end of Philippine cinema with the death
        of Brocka, revered for quite some time as the greatest Filipino director,
        in a car crash in 1991. As fate would have it, this critic had also passed
        on recently, much to the grief of those who were fond of him, including Diaz
        himself; and over the years, as Diaz has slowly been refining a language,
        Brocka has remained Brocka, inimitable, a product of his time, still venerated
        but with temperate understanding, the decline of puristic worship for him
        and his works a reflection not of dismissal or ignorance but of development,
        indicating that Philippine cinema, regardless of the road it takes or the
        cloak it wears, has always been, and will always be, bigger than Lino Brocka.</p>'

        replacing Larry Manda. It is a small but strongly committed crew, each of
        whom used to doing many things at once, exhibiting a particular temperament
        common among Diaz''s collaborators: low-key but efficient, simple but capable,
        serious at work but with enough sense of humor to agree, after some crazy
        wheedling from the director, to act on-screen when needed.</p>'

        or movement and associated only with the few people he regularly works with,
        has remained at the forefront of Philippine independent cinema: independent
        because he is not attached to the studios, independent because he is in reasonable

        being accountable for his people, paying them right and treating them well,
        upholding an independent cinema founded on responsible filmmaking and the

        of a simple childhood replete with traditional values taught by her parents.
        The Calapan of the 50s and 60s was very different from the Calapan of today,
        whose paved roads and lively commerce are characteristic of a city always
        looking ahead, especially now with a population of more than a hundred thousand.
        This small coastal community was Santos’s home for a good few years, a conservative
        town in touch with the world’s many tempting opportunities, in which at some
        point in her teenage years the seeds of her dreams had been planted.</p>'

        features and even softer demeanor, she was known for being a shy and reserved
        girl who, despite her willingness to appear in front of a crowd, had never
        felt comfortable being constantly stared at. Owing to her sheltered upbringing,
        she grew uptight — stiff to a fault — and too hard on herself, a kind of attitude
        that thwarted several opportunities to learn more about the world through
        experience, the strength of character needed for an actor to be effective.
        All of this changed in 1976, when Santos was crowned Miss Baron Travel Girl,
        enabling her to go on trips abroad and be featured on magazine covers. This,
        in turn, led to her being noticed by Lino Brocka and, after a successful audition,
        securing the lead role in Mike de Leon’s “Itim,” for which she won the best
        actress award at the 1977 Asian Film Festival. She certainly was not in Calapan

        that inspired this timid barrio lass to pursue her big dreams in Manila, the
        Calapan that in many ways had made her one of the most powerful personalities
        in the country, was no longer the Calapan she returned to more than 40 years

        and humility: someone who would strike up a conversation because it was her
        nature to listen, someone who asked questions whenever she was uncertain and
        would ask further to learn more, her eyes always curious and her manner never
        overriding, her naiveté making her more amiable and easier to approach. This
        became useful for Orencio when she had to bring Santos her “flying papers.”
        Every night, Diaz would look at his prepared script and revise it, and in
        the morning Orencio would go around and distribute the papers to the cast,
        for additional dialogue and instructions, and the art department, for possible
        changes in the production setup. Santos never raised objections to these things;
        in fact, she seemed all the more challenged by them. She was always ready
        for long lines of dialogue, and when the papers came, the text scrawled by
        either Diaz or Orencio, she would find a quiet spot and memorize them. Many
        of Diaz’s actors — including the stars of “Hele,” Piolo Pascual and John Lloyd
        Cruz — were skilled at committing to memory lengthy monologues and conversations,
        and Santos felt the obvious pressure on her. Her character, Horacia, goes
        searching for the person responsible for her frame-up and subsequent 30-year
        imprisonment, determined to know the truth; and here she was in her hometown,
        more than 30 years after “Kisapmata,” returning to form, with probably the
        toughest role in her acting career.</p>'

        “<em>Ni minsan hindi siya nag-</em>diva,” Diaz says. “<em>O nagsabing dalhan
        siya ng kahit ano. Walang</em> complaints. <em>Walang</em> special requests<em>.
        Hindi siya tinatawag para kumain</em> — <em>siya mismo mag-isa ang pumipila
        para kumuha. Kapag</em> break,<em> minsan, nakaupo lang siya sa tabi ng kalsada.
        Para siyang PA pa rin.</em>" This could be attributed to a peculiar fact:
        Santos was not a product of the big studios, hence she never acquired the
        habits common among popular stars at the time, some of whom were known for
        their outrageous demands and temper. She managed to stay away from this stereotype.</p>'

        how a crew of fewer than 20 members could make a feature of this scale so
        efficiently. The glitches didn’t feel at all like glitches but mere forces
        of nature. Inadvertently she was reminded of Star Cinema’s multiple setups
        with numerous lights and equipment, whereas in this shoot, more than half
        of the time, Diaz used only available lighting. “<em>Puwede palang walang
        ilaw,</em> Direk?<em> Paano ‘yan, madilim? Paano makikita</em>?” she’d ask.
        He said the camera he was using, a Sony a7s II, was a very intelligent device
        suited for low-light environments, adding that with the advanced technology
        these days, shooting a film didn’t necessarily require many people. She expressed
        her surprise repeatedly.</p>'

        There was no Filipinx community in my neighborhood or at school, and not much

        important for me and my brother to be assimilated into US culture. Aside from
        cooking, I grew up with very little connection to what it meant to be Filipinx.</p>'

        are mutually exclusive. They’re not, and in fact SF/F has become more vibrant

        As Michi might also tell you, there has been a fairly recent pushback against

        angry, conservative folks who are afraid that their own stories are being
        pushed out of the field. Watching their movement and realizing that people

        Since I write science fiction, fantasy, and horror, this otherness is often
        physicalized; for example, the protagonist in “Hungry Daughters of Starving
        Mothers” is a young woman who survives by eating people’s evil thoughts, transforming

        a secret from the people she loves, both out of a sense of shame and a desire
        to protect them, and ends up pushing them away.</p>'
