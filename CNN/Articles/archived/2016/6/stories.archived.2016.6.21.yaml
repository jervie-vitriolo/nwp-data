        I had a writing class where every meeting, our professor would photocopy one
        of our papers on acetate. He would project it and have the whole room criticize
        it, and the writer was also allowed to speak — but not to defend his work,
        of course. The author is dead, and in his place, a critic is born. The revelation
        of the writer happened just before the bell rang. It petrified me at first
        — this was face-to-face criticism, and we weren’t professionals on any level
        at all. So many things could go wrong, but mostly I was afraid to offend my
        fellow students who were there to learn, just like me.</p>'
