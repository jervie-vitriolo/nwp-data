        sign: the A with its apex curving like retro cocktail script and the caricature
        of a chef with his hefty mustache and bravado to serve. It was in this tiny,
        dimly lit Italian joint that a slice of blue cheese pizza would grant me a
        palate for the world. An older brother had taken me out to celebrate some
        special occasion or other — likely a birthday, maybe an excuse to take his
        high school girlfriend out — but I’m tempted to believe the ceremonious introduction
        to blue cheese was enough. It’s French, my brother noted, nudging me toward
        what smelled like a dare but tasted ultimately like a hard-earned reward.</p>'

        much more finite but definitely finer than a public library’s. My laminated
        Armchair Reader membership card was the only currency I kept in my Velcro

        display of low- and highbrow glossies with their parade of bold personalities,
        each ministering to the shy little gay boy in me. When you’re living in a
        house with six older brothers, after all, you’re not about to take People’s
        “Sexiest Man Alive” 1995 home with you, with an “Interview with the Vampire”-era

        converse over a meal, much less to sit quietly with a book. Where The Armchair
        Reader once was, a bingo parlor stood, the crisp sound of pages turned replaced
        by the impersonal announcement of numbers. More profitable, obviously, was

        tempting, if only to enjoy a low-key nightspot spared from mid-90s-born kids
        who are just discovering their tolerance for alcohol. But to not talk about
        it (or at the very least, tweet about it) would have been a disservice to
        a spot I’d like to come back to without finding it replaced by a Starbucks
        Reserve. With the Internet, we’re well-equipped to promote what we love, but
        a special place also needs its patrons — something we millennials could definitely
        be better at. Simply put, I’d better learn to put my money where my (digital)
        mouth is.</p>'
