        kumakanta,” one of the senior choir members told me after I sang a responsorial
        Psalm during a Sunday mass. I wanted to assure him that, despite my budding
        gayness at that age — I was 12 years old then — it was unintentional. I didn’t
        want to sound like a birit diva tearing through "Ang Panginoon ang Aking Tanglaw"
        but my voice hasn’t cracked yet. Puberty has yet to further embalm my body
        with awkwardness. I thought “ipit ang boses” was a technique that allowed
        me to explore the possibilities of my singing. But in hindsight, it really
        was just a gay boy’s way of connecting through songs, maximizing his little
        voice before it croaks to reveal he’s really no good.</p>'

      'text': '<p>How do you end a world consumed by its own corruption? In Lav Diaz’s
        “Norte: Hangganan ng Kasaysayan,” Fabian (Sid Lucero), a law school dropout,
        sees no point in continuing the morality imposed by societal conventions on
        a dying civilization. Fabian goes on to ramble about his philosophy to his
        professors — the coffee shop they’re in being the most innocuous venue for
        such discussion — how the negation of truth and everything society perceives
        as “wrong” is also an act of liberation in itself. After minutes of discussion,
        he then proceeds to borrow rent money from his audience. Fabian postulates
        his ideations as somewhat that of a radical’s, someone who is drunk on the
        power of living, enough to put his own theories to their own destructive course.</p>'

        Punishment” — the Russian author being a lifelong obsession in Diaz’s filmography

        setting. Fabian is Raskolnikov, Dostoyevsky’s extremely handsome dilettante
        whose loathing towards normalcy and ethics is the spark that sets off an upheaval
        of another world. High on the sway of his own call to arms, Fabian goes on
        to murder his pawnbroker (Mae Paner, devilishly devoid of her Juana Change
        look) and her daughter, launching into ruin not only of his own but of another
        parallel universe. In “Norte,” the fall is taken by Joaquin (Archie Alemania,
        far from his comedic comfort zone), a pirated DVD peddler accused of the pawnbroker’s
        murder, his ties to her include a mountain of debt and a short burst of a
        tantrum after she refused to return his wife’s ring.</p>'

        from the shattered life they are consigned to living. Joaquin’s wife, Eliza
        (the quietly powerful Angeli Bayani), tries to make ends meet, selling vegetables
        in a rickety cart around their town while Joaquin desperately lives his saintly
        disposition inside the prison, never crossing boundaries and keeping his mouth
        shut if needed. This is a set-up for a dreary exposition into squalor and
        defeat, but Diaz, never one to indulge in such games, opts instead to steer
        his four-hour film (which runs like a breeze even for a millennial attention

        core through Strayed''s connections with music (humming Simon and Garfunkel''s
        “El Condor Pasa” as one of the unyielding links between her and the beloved
        memory of her mother, dispensing quotes from several authors to bookmark chapters
        of her journey throughout the trail etc.): fragments that drift in and out
        as Strayed journeys a thousand miles to retribution. “Wild” succeeds at eloquently
        mapping the physical toil of unraveling and how the weight of our memories
        can both be a burden and a guide along the lonely road.</p>'

        come by. Standard siopaos are available, though for just a little more, their

        filling, premium buns come in asado, bola-bola with salted egg, tocino, and
        chicken asado. The 7-Eleven rice meals range from beef gyudon and chicken
        curry, to their line of Chef Creations by Claude Tayag, which comes in pork
        picadillo, binagoongan, and pulled pork with adobo dip.</p>'

      'text': '<p><strong>Manila (CNN Philippines Life) —</strong> <em>“Parang babae
        yung kumakanta,”</em> one of the senior choir members told me after I sang
        a responsorial Psalm during a Sunday mass. I wanted to assure him that, despite
        my budding gayness at that age — I was 12 years old then — it was unintentional.
        I didn’t want to sound like a <em>birit</em> diva tearing through <em>"Ang
        Panginoon ang Aking Tanglaw"</em> but my voice hasn’t cracked yet. Puberty
        has yet to further embalm my body with awkwardness. I thought <em>“ipit ang
        boses”</em> was a technique that allowed me to explore the possibilities of
        my singing. But in hindsight, it really was just a gay boy’s way of connecting
        through songs, maximizing his little voice before it croaks to reveal he’s
        really no good.</p>'

        10 p.m. The NLEX-SCTEX-TPLEX route will take you to La Union in four hours
        or less.”</p>'

        “Norte: <em>Hangganan ng Kasaysayan,”</em> Fabian (Sid Lucero), a law school
        dropout, sees no point in continuing the morality imposed by societal conventions
        on a dying civilization. Fabian goes on to ramble about his philosophy to
        his professors — the coffee shop they’re in being the most innocuous venue
        for such discussion — how the negation of truth and everything society perceives
        as “wrong” is also an act of liberation in itself. After minutes of discussion,
        he then proceeds to borrow rent money from his audience. Fabian postulates
        his ideations as somewhat that of a radical’s, someone who is drunk on the
        power of living, enough to put his own theories to their own destructive course.</p>'

        setting. Fabian is Raskolnikov, Dostoyevsky’s extremely handsome dilettante
        whose loathing towards normalcy and ethics is the spark that sets off an upheaval
        of another world. High on the sway of his own call to arms, Fabian goes on
        to murder his pawnbroker (Mae Paner, devilishly devoid of her Juana Change
        look) and her daughter, launching into ruin not only of his own but of another
        parallel universe. In “Norte,” the fall is taken by Joaquin (Archie Alemania,
        far from his comedic comfort zone), a pirated DVD peddler accused of the pawnbroker’s
        murder, his ties to her include a mountain of debt and a short burst of a
        tantrum after she refused to return his wife’s ring.</p>'

        from the shattered life they are consigned to living. Joaquin’s wife, Eliza
        (the quietly powerful Angeli Bayani), tries to make ends meet, selling vegetables
        in a rickety cart around their town while Joaquin desperately lives his saintly
        disposition inside the prison, never crossing boundaries and keeping his mouth
        shut if needed. This is a set-up for a dreary exposition into squalor and
        defeat, but Diaz, never one to indulge in such games, opts instead to steer
        his four-hour film (which runs like a breeze even for a millennial attention
        span such as this writer’s) into an astonishing study of madness and its accompanying
        instruments.</p>'
